# This file contains the necessary Python package dependencies for the Reinforcement Learning algorithms 
# implemented in this project. These packages are required to run the different algorithms and environments 
# such as Snake Game with DQN, SARSA, Q-Learning, and the Frozen Lake environment with A2C.

# Dependencies:
# - numpy: A package for numerical operations, required for array manipulation and math functions.
# - gym: A toolkit for developing and comparing RL environments. Used for creating the Frozen Lake environment.
# - matplotlib: A plotting library to visualize the training process (e.g., rewards, losses).
# - tensorflow: A deep learning framework used for implementing DQN with neural networks.
# - torch: A deep learning framework used for implementing reinforcement learning models (e.g., A2C).
# - stable-baselines3: A set of reliable implementations of RL algorithms for use with OpenAI Gym.
# - pytorch-lightning: A wrapper for PyTorch that simplifies training and helps with model scaling.
# - pandas: A library for data manipulation and analysis (e.g., storing and analyzing results).
# - scikit-learn: A machine learning library for additional utilities like model selection and preprocessing.
