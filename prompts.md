## Business Problem Statement

In today's fast-evolving technology landscape, **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** is increasingly being used to solve complex decision-making problems in various industries, from autonomous vehicles to personalized recommendations. The challenge lies in developing algorithms that can learn optimal strategies from interaction with an environment. 

The project demonstrates the application of RL through four algorithms: **SARSA**, **Q-Learning**, **DQN**, and **Actor-Critic (A2C)**, implemented in the context of a **Snake Game** and the **Frozen Lake** environment. Each algorithm learns to maximize rewards while avoiding penalties, which can directly translate to various real-world applications such as **game AI**, **robotics**, and **autonomous systems**. 

The business problem this project addresses is the development of **intelligent agents** capable of learning optimal strategies through **trial and error**, thereby improving their performance over time, which is essential for creating adaptive systems in unpredictable environments.

## DQN (Deep Q-Network) for Snake Game

**Description:**
The DQN algorithm is an off-policy reinforcement learning technique that uses a neural network to approximate the Q-value function. In the context of the Snake Game, it learns the optimal policy by approximating the expected future rewards for each possible action at each state.

**Task:**
- Implement the Deep Q-Learning algorithm to train an agent to play the Snake Game.
- Use a neural network as the Q-function approximator.
- Implement the experience replay mechanism to store and sample previous experiences.
- Use epsilon-greedy exploration to balance exploration and exploitation.

**Key Concepts:**
- Q-learning
- Deep Q-Networks (DQN)
- Experience Replay
- Epsilon-greedy Exploration

## A2C (Advantage Actor-Critic) for Frozen Lake Game

**Description:**
The A2C algorithm is an on-policy reinforcement learning algorithm that combines both value-based and policy-based methods. It consists of two components: the Actor (which updates the policy) and the Critic (which evaluates the policy by estimating the value function). In this implementation, A2C is used to solve the Frozen Lake environment.

**Task:**
- Implement the Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm for the Frozen Lake game.
- Separate the agent into two components: the Actor and the Critic.
- Use the Critic to estimate the value of states and the Actor to update the policy.
- Implement the advantage function to improve the learning stability.
- Use a neural network to represent both the actor and the critic.

**Key Concepts:**
- Actor-Critic methods
- Policy Gradient
- Advantage function
- Value Function Approximation

## SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action) for Snake Game

**Description:**
SARSA is an on-policy reinforcement learning algorithm that updates the Q-values based on the action actually taken, not the optimal action. In the context of the Snake Game, SARSA learns an optimal policy by iteratively updating Q-values while exploring the environment.

**Task:**
- Implement the SARSA algorithm for the Snake Game.
- Update Q-values based on the agentâ€™s current state, action, reward, next state, and next action.
- Use epsilon-greedy exploration to balance exploration and exploitation.
- Demonstrate the performance of SARSA in the Snake Game.

**Key Concepts:**
- On-policy learning
- Q-values
- Epsilon-greedy Exploration
- Temporal Difference learning

## Q-Learning for Snake Game

**Description:**
Q-Learning is an off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm that learns the optimal action-value function by iterating through states and actions. It is a model-free algorithm that uses the Bellman equation to update Q-values. This implementation is applied to the Snake Game.

**Task:**
- Implement the Q-Learning algorithm for the Snake Game.
- Use Q-values to learn the optimal policy for the agent.
- Update the Q-values based on the agent's experiences using the Bellman equation.
- Implement epsilon-greedy exploration to ensure a balance between exploration and exploitation.

**Key Concepts:**
- Off-policy learning
- Q-values
- Bellman equation
- Epsilon-greedy Exploration

- **Testing and Evaluation**: Test each algorithm's performance in the corresponding game or environment.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experiment with different values for hyperparameters such as learning rate, discount factor, exploration rate (epsilon), and the number of episodes to improve the performance.
- **Visualization**: Plot the training performance over episodes (e.g., total rewards per episode) to visualize the learning progress.
