# Snake Game AI

This project is an AI-powered version of the classic Snake game using Deep Q-Learning (DQN) with a neural network agent. The agent learns to navigate and maximize its score by consuming food while avoiding collisions. Built using Python and Pygame, this project leverages machine learning to train an agent that becomes increasingly skilled at playing the game autonomously.

## Features
- **AI-powered gameplay:** A Deep Q-Learning (DQN) agent learns to play the game.
- **Visualized training:** Track performance with score and max-score graphs after training.
- **Customizable training parameters:** Adjust episodes, learning rate, epsilon decay, etc., for experimentation.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Libraries: 
  - `pygame`
  - `numpy`
  - `tensorflow`
  - `keras`
  - `matplotlib`
